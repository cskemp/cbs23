    "# Diffusion and contagion\n",
    "We are considering spread on a static network, spread of the kind that once you are 'infected' you stay infected, whether this be by an idea or a disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Small worlds\n",
    "Think of stylised network where everyone has the same degree but where there are not redundant ties that create cycles. In such a network, a person can reach an additional $d^k$ unique others at each step, as in the left-hand panel. Should some ties be re-wired to close open triads, the number of nodes the focal actor can reach is reduced significantly as in the right-hand panel.\n",

    "What implications does this have for diffusion on networks where we have clustering as opposed to random Bernoulli networks?\n",

    "## Web resources\n",
    "Some realy good tutorials on <https://kateto.net/network-visualization> and, also, a nice online simulator for ERGM at <https://michaellevy.shinyapps.io/gwdegree/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic setup\n",
    "We are going to assume that there is a static network, $X$, and that, in continuous time, nodes in the network may become 'infected' by their neighbours. We model the state of all of the nodes by a binary vector $Y$, where at time $t$, $Y(t)$ is \n",
    "* equal to 1, if the nodes has adopted the innovation/become infected, and\n",
    "* equal to 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time to adoption\n",
    "What we want to model is the *time until adoption*, the time, given the state of the system, at which point a node $i$ goes from $Y_i(t)=0$ to $Y(t+\\delta)=1$. A basic component in this is the *rate of change* - if someone has a higher rate of change, they are likely to change more quickly that if they have a low rate of change.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $s_j(x)$ is the importance of $j$, a function that may be network dependent. This could for example be centrality, as in  Strang and Tuma (1993). Transmission or diffusion does not take place on the edges of the graph here.\n",

    "so that the higher proportion of contacts that have adopted, the higher the risk of $i$ adopting. Note that the risks/rates with be identical for a person with one alter that has adopted as for a person with $k$ alters, all of whom have adopted.\n",
