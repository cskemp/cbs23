    "This tutorial focuses on Bayesian networks, also known as Bayes nets or directed graphical models. Bayes nets provide a natural way to capture and compute with joint probability distributions. In general, a joint distribution defined over $n$ binary variables requires $2^n -1$ numbers to specify. A Bayes net can allow this distribution to be specified using many fewer numbers. The savings arise because a Bayes net allow a high-dimensional joint distribution to be expressed as a product of lower-dimensional distributions, each of which captures a modular piece of a situation.\n",

We won't cover these algorithms in this class, but will instead use a package called [NIMBLE]( https://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf ) to carry out inference by sampling. For today we won't worry about what NIMBLE is doing under the hood --- the goal is just to learn how to use the package.\n",

So don't worry if it takes you a while to get comfortable using it, and as always please ask for help when you get stuck. When you're using NIMBLE for real, you'd probably want to specify parameters including the number of samples that you'd like to draw. We won't worry about that today -- we'll just use package defaults to keep things simple.\n",
