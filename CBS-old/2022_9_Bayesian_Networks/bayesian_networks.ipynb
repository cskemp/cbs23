    "There is no tutorial this week, but we encourage you to work through this notebook to practice what you've learned about Bayesian networks (also known as Bayes nets or directed graphical models). Bayes nets provide a natural way to capture and compute with joint probability distributions. In general, a joint distribution defined over $n$ binary variables requires $2^n -1$ numbers to specify. A Bayes net can allow this distribution to be specified using many fewer numbers. The savings arise because a Bayes net allow a high-dimensional joint distribution to be expressed as a product of lower-dimensional distributions, each of which captures a modular piece of a situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll work with a variant of an example introduced by Judea Pearl. Pearl lives in Los Angeles, and suppose that he's just had a new alarm installed. The alarm reliably detects robbers, but also occasionally malfunctions and sounds for no apparent reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorial for Week 7 recall that we worked with a joint probability distribution over three variables: Robbery (R), Earthquake (E) and Alarm (A). There we just enumerated the entire joint distribution, but here we formulate a joint distribution over the variables using a Bayes net.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get started by considering just two of the variables: Robbery and Alarm. A Bayes net that captures a joint distribution over these two variables is shown below. On any given day, we've assumed that the probability of a robbery occurring is low (0.05). This number will make things simple but is too high to be realistic --- even in LA burglaries don't occur once per twenty days! \n",
    "\n",
    "To adopt the same convention from previous weeks, we'll use 1 for FALSE and 2 (which rhymes with TRUE) for TRUE. So A = 2 means that the alarm sounds and A = 1 means that the alarm does not sound.\n"
