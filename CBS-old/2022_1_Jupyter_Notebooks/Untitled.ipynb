    "A discussion thread is available for each week under the Discussions tab on the learning management system. If you have a question, please check the discussion to see if your question has already been addressed. If it hasn't been addressed, please post your question to the thread. Almost all class-related questions should be posted to the discussion board instead of sent to the instructors directly --- that way everyone in the class can see the responses. If you see a question on the Discussion board that you're able to answer, please jump in and do so.\n",

Typically you'll be asked to edit some of the code chunks and to add text in response to short answer questions. This introductory notebook will be graded automatically but the grade will not count.
